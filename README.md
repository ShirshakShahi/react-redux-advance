## Advance Redux Concepts.

1. Use `configureStore` to set up your Redux store with sensible defaults.
2. Use slice reducers to handle specific parts of your state tree.
3. Redux Toolkit handles immutability for you, so you can directly modify state.
4. Redux Toolkit combines action creators and reducers in one place using `createSlice`.
5. Use `createAsyncThunk` for handling asynchronous logic like loading and error states.
6. Use selectors with `createSelector`  to drive data from the state.
7. Redux Toolkit integrates well with Redux Dev Tools Extensions for debugging.
